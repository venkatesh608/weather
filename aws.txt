A **QA (Quality Assurance)** job role during API and UI development by the app team typically involves making sure that everything being built works correctly, meets the requirements, and is free of bugs. Here's a breakdown of what a QA person usually does in this context:

---

### **1. Understanding Requirements**
- Review **API documentation** (like Swagger) and **UI designs/wireframes** to understand what’s expected.
- Ensure that test cases cover all requirements.

---

### **2. Test Planning & Design**
- Write **test cases** for both **APIs** and **UI flows** based on the requirements.
- Use tools like Postman or Swagger for API test cases.
- Define what to test: functional, negative, edge cases, etc.

---

### **3. API Testing**
- Test APIs for:
  - **Correct responses**
  - **Status codes** (200, 400, 500, etc.)
  - **Data validation**
  - **Authentication/authorization**
  - **Performance**
- Use tools like:
  - **Postman**
  - **SoapUI**
  - **JMeter** (for load testing)
  - **Automation frameworks** (like RestAssured or Karate)

---

### **4. UI Testing**
- Test the UI for:
  - Correct data binding from APIs
  - Usability and user experience
  - Layout/responsiveness
  - Navigation flows
  - Form validation
- Use tools like:
  - Manual testing (click-through)
  - Selenium, Cypress, Playwright (for automation)

---

### **5. Defect Reporting**
- Log bugs in tools like **JIRA** or **Bugzilla**
- Include steps to reproduce, screenshots/videos, and logs.

---

### **6. Regression & Retesting**
- Retest after fixes.
- Run **regression tests** to make sure new code didn’t break existing functionality.

---

### **7. Collaboration**
- Work closely with developers, product managers, and designers.
- Participate in standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

---

### Optional (Advanced QA Roles):
- Set up **CI/CD integration** for automated test runs.
- Monitor backend logs or use tools like **Charles Proxy** or **Fiddler** to inspect traffic.
